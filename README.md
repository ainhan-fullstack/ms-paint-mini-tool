**Drawing App**
  - A simple drawing application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows you to draw on a canvas using a variety of tools, including a brush, rectangle, square, circle, and eraser. It also includes handy features like undo/redo, clear, and custom settings for stroke color and line width.

**Features**
  - Multiple Drawing Tools:
    - Brush: Freehand drawing.
    - Rectangle, Square, Circle: Draw precise shapes.
    - Eraser: Remove unwanted parts of your drawing.
  - Undo/Redo Functionality: Step backward or forward through your drawing history.
  - Clear Canvas: Quickly clear the entire canvas.
  - Customizable Settings: Change stroke color and line width.
  - MS Paint-Inspired Toolbar: Classic button styling with a descending effect on click and when selected.
  - Responsive Canvas: Automatically resizes to fit the browser window.

**How It Works**
  - Canvas: The drawing board fills the screen, providing a space for creating art.
  - Toolbar: Located on the side, the toolbar lets you select different drawing tools and adjust settings.
  - Custom Cursor: A dynamic cursor enhances your drawing experience by following your mouse movements.

**Usage**
  - Open the App

  - Undo/Redo
    - Use the undo and redo buttons, or use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Z for undo, Ctrl/Cmd + Y or Shift + Ctrl/Cmd + Z for redo) to navigate through your drawing history.

**Code Structure**
  - HTML5: Provides the structure for the drawing app.
  - CSS3: Adds styling and visual effects to mimic a classic MS Paint interface.
